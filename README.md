Final Report: Image Enhancement & Processing Using Machine Learning
1. Introduction
The project "Image Enhancement & Processing Using Machine Learning" aimed to develop a machine learning-based approach to improve image quality by reducing noise, enhancing resolution, and applying advanced filters. The project spanned 5-6 days and involved a combination of traditional image processing techniques and deep learning models. The dataset used was the "unsplash-images-collection" from Kaggle, which contains a diverse set of high-resolution images.

This report provides a detailed overview of the project, including the methodologies, implementation, results, challenges faced, and key learnings.

2. Project Objectives
The primary objectives of the project were:

Enhance Image Quality: Improve the visual quality of images by reducing noise, sharpening edges, and adjusting contrast.

Implement ML-Based Techniques: Use deep learning models (Autoencoders, GANs) for advanced image enhancement.

Evaluate Performance: Compare traditional and ML-based techniques using quantitative metrics like PSNR and SSIM.

Deliver a Comprehensive Solution: Provide a robust pipeline for image enhancement that can be extended for real-world applications.

3. Methodology
3.1 Dataset Exploration
Dataset: The "unsplash-images-collection" dataset from Kaggle was used. It contains high-resolution images in various categories.

Exploration:

Images were analyzed for common quality issues such as noise, low resolution, and poor lighting.

A subset of images was selected for experimentation to ensure diversity.

3.2 Data Preprocessing
Grayscale Conversion: Images were converted to grayscale to simplify processing.

Resizing: Images were resized to a uniform size (e.g., 128x128 pixels) to ensure consistency.

Normalization: Pixel values were normalized to the range [0, 1] for better compatibility with ML models.

Noise Handling: Techniques like Gaussian blurring were applied to reduce noise.

3.3 Traditional Image Enhancement Techniques
Histogram Equalization: Used to improve contrast by redistributing pixel intensities.

Gaussian Blurring: Applied to reduce noise and smooth images.

Sharpening: Enhanced edges using kernel-based filters.

3.4 Deep Learning-Based Enhancement
Autoencoders:

A convolutional autoencoder was implemented to learn a compressed representation of images and reconstruct them with enhanced quality.

The model was trained on noisy images to denoise and enhance them.

GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks):

A simplified GAN was implemented for super-resolution, where the generator aimed to produce high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs.

The discriminator was trained to distinguish between real and generated images.

3.5 Evaluation Metrics
PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio): Measured the quality of enhanced images compared to the original.

SSIM (Structural Similarity Index): Evaluated the structural similarity between original and enhanced images.

4. Implementation
4.1 Tools and Libraries
Python Libraries:

OpenCV: For traditional image processing.

TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training deep learning models.

Scikit-Image: For advanced image processing and evaluation metrics.

Matplotlib: For visualization.

    images = []
    for img_name in os.listdir(dataset_path):
        img_path = os.path.join(dataset_path, img_name)
        img = Image.open(img_path).convert('L')  # Grayscale
        img = img.resize(img_size)  # Resize
        img = img_to_array(img) / 255.0  # Normalize
        images.append(img)
    return np.array(images)

    # Decoder

    x = UpSampling2D((2, 2))(x)
    decoded = Conv2D(1, (3, 3), activation='sigmoid', padding='same')(x)
    autoencoder = Model(input_img, decoded)
    autoencoder.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')

5.2 Visual Results
Original vs. Enhanced Images:

Traditional techniques improved contrast and reduced noise but lacked fine details.

6. Challenges Faced
Dataset Size and Diversity:

The dataset was large, requiring significant preprocessing and computational resources.

Ensuring diversity in the subset of images used for training was challenging.

Model Training:

Training deep learning models (especially GANs) was computationally expensive and time-consuming.

GANs were prone to instability during training, requiring careful tuning of hyperparameters.

Evaluation Metrics:

PSNR and SSIM provided quantitative measures but did not always align with visual quality.

Hardware Limitations:

Limited GPU resources slowed down the training process for deep learning models.

7. Key Learnings
Importance of Preprocessing: Proper preprocessing (resizing, normalization) is critical for model performance.

Trade-offs Between Techniques: Traditional techniques are faster but less effective than deep learning models for complex enhancements.

GANs for Super-Resolution: GANs are powerful but require significant computational resources and expertise to train effectively.

8. Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrated the application of machine learning for image enhancement. Traditional techniques provided a baseline, while deep learning models (Autoencoders and GANs) delivered superior results. Future work could focus on optimizing GAN training and exploring advanced architectures like ESRGAN for super-resolution.
